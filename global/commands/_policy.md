# Global Command Policies

- Git/GitHub output (commits, PRs, issues, release notes): English
- No emojis in commits, PR titles, issue titles
- Commit format: Conventional Commits (`type(scope): description`)
- Use closing keywords (`Closes #N`) in PR descriptions when applicable
- All builds must pass before PR; all CI checks before merge
- See `rules/workflow/build-verification.md` for verification patterns
