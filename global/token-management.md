# Token Management

## Usage Limits

- **No artificial limits**: Provide complete and detailed analysis and responses without token count restrictions
- **Quality over quantity**: Prioritize comprehensive answers that fully address user needs

## Token Optimization

While there are no hard limits, be mindful of:
- Loading only relevant context for each task
- Using modular configuration files to reduce unnecessary context
- Focusing on essential information while maintaining completeness
