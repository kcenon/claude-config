# Universal Development Guidelines

Universal conventions for this repository. Works with global settings in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

Rules use YAML frontmatter (`alwaysApply`, `paths`) for automatic loading.
Reference docs in `rules/*/reference/` are excluded via `.claudeignore` — load with `@load:`.
Defer to language-specific conventions (PEP 8, C++ Core Guidelines, etc.).
