# API Design Skill

## When to Use

- Designing REST or GraphQL APIs
- Architecture and microservices design
- Setting up logging and observability
- Implementing rate limiting or authentication
- Code review for API endpoints

## Reference Documents (Import Syntax)

### API Design
@reference/api-design.md

### Architecture
@reference/architecture.md

### Observability
@reference/logging.md
@reference/observability.md

## Core Principles

1. **RESTful conventions**: Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
2. **SOLID principles**: Apply design patterns appropriately
3. **Structured logging**: Include context and correlation IDs
4. **Observability**: Implement metrics, traces, and health checks
