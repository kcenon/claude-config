# API Design Skill

## When to Use

- Designing REST or GraphQL APIs
- Architecture and microservices design
- Setting up logging and observability
- Implementing rate limiting or authentication
- Code review for API endpoints

## Quick Reference

### API Design

- [API Design](reference/api-design.md)

### Architecture

- [Architecture and Design](reference/architecture.md)

### Observability

- [Logging Standards](reference/logging.md)
- [Observability](reference/observability.md)

## Core Principles

1. **RESTful conventions**: Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
2. **SOLID principles**: Apply design patterns appropriately
3. **Structured logging**: Include context and correlation IDs
4. **Observability**: Implement metrics, traces, and health checks
