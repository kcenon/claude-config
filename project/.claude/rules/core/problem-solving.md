# Problem‑Solving Principles

This guideline establishes the core principles for approaching and solving problems systematically.

## Follow Procedures

Execute tasks systematically according to the plan derived from your analysis.

## Minimal Changes

Prefer modifying existing files; create new files only when absolutely necessary.

## Data Integrity

Use real data, never dummy or placeholder values, when modifying the codebase.
