# Core Principles

1. **Think Before Acting** — State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
2. **Minimize & Focus** — Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
3. **Surgical Precision** — Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
4. **Verify & Iterate** — Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Self-check: "Would a senior engineer say this diff is focused, minimal, and well-verified?"
