# Question Handling Procedure

> **Version**: 1.1.0
> **Extracted from**: workflow.md
> **Purpose**: Defines the standard procedure for processing user questions

## 1. Translate

- **Internal processing**: Translate the user's question into English internally for comprehensive understanding
- **Display translation**: Show the English translation to the user at the beginning of the response
- **Context preservation**: Maintain the original question's context and nuances during translation

## 2. Analyze

- **Task breakdown**: Decompose the problem into clear, manageable tasks
- **Identify assumptions**: Explicitly state any assumptions being made
- **Highlight constraints**: Note technical, time, or resource constraints
- **Missing information**: Call out any information gaps that could affect the solution

## 3. Present

- **Share analysis**: Present your understanding and planned approach to the user before proceeding
- **Encourage feedback**: Invite the user to correct misunderstandings or provide clarifications
- **Confirm direction**: Wait for user approval on complex or ambiguous tasks before implementation

## Best Practices

- **Incremental progress**: Make changes incrementally and verify each step
- **Testing**: Test changes as you go, not just at the end
- **Rollback readiness**: Keep changes reversible until confirmed working
- **Communication**: Keep the user informed of progress and any issues encountered
