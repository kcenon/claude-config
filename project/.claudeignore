# DEPRECATED: .claudeignore is not an official Claude Code feature
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/579
#
# Migration Status:
# - Security-related exclusions moved to settings.json permissions.deny
# - Token optimization exclusions remain here as .claudeignore may work in some versions
# - See docs/TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md for details
#
# Original: Aggressive Token Optimization v1.2.0
# Excludes EVERYTHING except core essentials
# Command-specific modules are loaded on demand (see conditional-loading.md)

# LARGE META-DOCUMENTATION (Load on demand via @load directive)
# These are about token optimization itself, rarely needed
