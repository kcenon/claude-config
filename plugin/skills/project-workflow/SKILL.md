## Core Principles

1. **Systematic approach**: Follow procedures step by step
2. **Minimal changes**: Modify existing files, create new ones only when necessary
3. **Conventional commits**: Use proper type(scope): description format
4. **5W1H framework**: Apply What, Why, Who, When, Where, How for issues and PRs
5. **Layered testing**: Unit tests (many) -> Integration tests (some) -> E2E tests (few)
